# Write a program for a guessing game. Tell the user to pick a number from 1 - 100
# Take the user's input (int) and the program will tell if the user's guess is correct
# If the user's input is not correct, tell them if the guess was too high or too low.
# You may incorporate a while loop, if you already understand, to let the program run until a guess is correct.


import random

number = random.randint (1, 100)
user_input = 0

while user_input != number:
  user_input = int(input("Guess the number : "))

  if user_input > number:
    print("too high")
  elif user_input < number:
    print("too low")
  else:
    print("You got it")
